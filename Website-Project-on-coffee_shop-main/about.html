        <h1><u>About Us</u></h1>
        <h1 class="story">Our Story</h1>

        <p> Our journey began with a simple love for coffee. What started as 
            a passion project has grown into a community of coffee lovers who appreciate 
            the rich aromas, diverse flavors, and the artistry behind every cup. We source our
             beans from the best farms around the world, carefully selecting each batch to ensure 
             quality and freshness. Our goal is to bring people 
            together over a shared love of coffee, one cup at a time.</p>



            <h1><i>><u><b>Culture Espresso is an independent and locally owned coffee shop that opened in 2009.</b></u></i></h1>
                <P>We pride ourselves on bringing the best coffee to the heart of New York City.  We also offer a daily assortment of fresh baked goods and our Award Winning Chocolate Chip Cookies. 
                </p>
                <h1><b><i><u> Espresso</b></u></i></h1>
                <P> Espresso owns two locations in New York City (both loved by the people of New York). They serve inventive coffee drinks and fresh cookies & pastries.

                    This café website nails the vibe quotient a coffee shop website demands. It does so by showcasing natural pictures of their coffee, the people making it, and the people enjoying it with friends. The beige background color just adds to it.
                    
                    </P>

             <h1><i><u><b>TRUE BARISTAS</b></u></i></h1>
            <p>What we like: The orange banner claiming "the true coffee experience" immediately piques your curiosity about this coffee shop.
                 The crowd around the truck and packed tables send further signals that this place might be cool.

                So, when you decide to explore the site a little bit further, you’ll be hooked by popular menu items like large coffee portions, specialties, and cookies. On True Baristas’ site,
                 you can also order the coffee of the week right from the website and pick it up in 15 minutes.
                  This is a truly nice feature to drive more sales of a particular product.</p>
