                <h2>Cold Brew</h2>
                <p><h3>Smooth and less acidic, cold brew is made by steeping coffee grounds in cold water for an extended time.
                    Per 1 cup of water, you’ll need 1 ounce (by weight) coarsely ground coffee. 
                    That’s about 1/4 cup whole coffee beans, which yields roughly 1/2 cup ground coffee. 
                    If you’re accustomed to the metric system, 1 ounce is equal to 28 grams.</h3></p>

                <h2>Caramel Macchiato</h2>
                <p><h3>Rich espresso with steamed milk, topped with frothy foam and a drizzle of caramel for a sweet finish.
                    caramel – You will need EITHER my caramel syrup recipe for coffee OR microwave caramel sauce to flavor the drink itself. Then, you may want more caramel sauce to garnish the drink, but this is optional.
                    milk – I love a drink made with whole milk (and it’s always in my fridge because I have a growing preschooler). But you can also use a lower fat milk for this recipe.
                    coffee – you’ll need 1 cup (8 ounces) of hot brewed coffee. Make a small pot of coffee, or use a Nespresso or Keurig pod. More on choosing a coffee roast below!
                    whipped cream – this is optional but highly encouraged for garnishing the drink (and lemon pancakes).</h3></p>

                <h2>Flat White Coffee</h2>
                <p><h3>step 1
                    Make around 35ml espresso using your coffee machine and pour into the base of your cup.
                    
                    step 2
                    Steam the milk with the steamer attachment so that it has around 1-2cm of foam on top. 
                    Hold the jug so that the spout is about 3-4cm above the cup and pour the milk in steadily.
                     As the volume within the cup increases, bring the jug as close to the surface of the drink as possible whilst aiming to pour into the centre. 
                     Once the milk jug is almost touching the surface of the coffee, tilt the jug to speed up the rate of pour.
                      As you accelerate, the milk will hit the back of the cup and start naturally folding in on itself to create a pattern on the top</h3>

                <h2>Americano coffee</h2>
                <p><h3>An Americano, simply put, is espresso poured over hot water (or hot water poured over espresso if you prefer). 
                    Also known as a "caffè Americano," this coffee drink is believed to have received its name during World War II, 
                    when American G.I.'s in Italy would dilute espresso with water to drink the coffee they were used to in America.

                </h3><h4>Step 1: Add a double shot of espresso (the standard for most specialty coffee drinks) to a tall coffee cup. Never made espresso before? Use our step-by-step guide to making espresso at home. 

                    Step 2: Pour your hot water over top. 
                    
                    Expert Tip: If you'd like to keep the crema—the caramel-colored froth—on top of your Americano coffee, it's best to add your water to the mug first, gently pouring your espresso over top. </h4>
